Hepburn: Metaru Gia Raijingu: Ribenjensu?) is an action video game developed by Platinum Games and produced by Kojima Productions, for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles.[1][8] It is the ninth game in the Metal Gear series, with a plot set four years after the events of Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. The story focuses on the cyborg ninja, Raiden, in a fight against a private military company known as Desperado Enterprises.[9] Although a Japanese release for the Xbox 360
platform was planned, that version was cancelled.[7]
The game was originally announced in 2009 under the title of Metal Gear Solid: Rising, and was intended to act as an interquel between the events of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. This form of the game was to be produced solely by Kojima Productions.[10][11] However, the Kojima Productions team met with difficulties in developing a game based on swordplay, so the franchise director Hideo Kojima cancelled it. A solution was found, in
late 2011, with Platinum Games taking over development. Under the guidance of the new team, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance was revealed, with a significant change in gameplay. The game's setting was changed to give Platinum more creative freedom. Kojima Productions retained responsibility for the game's overall plot and Raiden's design.
